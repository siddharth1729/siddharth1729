I am a Software Engineer based in India.

- I started off my career as a Software Engineer and have experience working
  with backend, infrastructure and performance issues.
- I have experience in working with `Nodejs`, `TypeScript`, `Arc.codes`,
  `Java`, `Rust`, `Nginx`, `PostgreSql`,  `GitHub Action`, `AWS services` and `Docker`.
- Along the way, I developed an interest for lower level systems such as
  database system, storage engines, protocols, networking, observability and etc.
- Hence, I've decided to pivot my careers towards working on parallel computing, performance computing, storage engine, lower level
  systems.

To make that a reality, I spend most of my time reading reaserch papers, courses and reading codes
to become a better programmer.

<!-- 
- Currently learning about Rust, database system,  storage engines, network programming, distributed system and exploring the unknowns.
- Writing a [RedRusDB](https://github.com/RedRusDB/redrus) in Rust from scratch. (Currently in private)
- Writing a [Non-Blocking Concurrent Data Structures](https://github.com/siddharth1729/nonblocking_datastructures) in Rust. (Currently in private)
- Writing about how I implement a database system in Rust [RedRusDB Doc](https://redrusdb.github.io/.github).
- Learning about Rust, database system, network programming, distributed system and exploring the unknowns. -->



Outside of programming, I enjoy writing and sharing what I learned. You
can find out more about my writings at my [website][0].
